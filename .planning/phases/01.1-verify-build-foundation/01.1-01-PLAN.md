<objective>
Verify that Phase 1 (Build Foundation) work was completed correctly by examining existing code artifacts and confirming all BUILD-01 through BUILD-08 requirements are satisfied.

Purpose: Close documentation gap from audit finding. Phase 1 was executed but GSD verification artifacts (VERIFICATION.md, SUMMARY.md) were never created because work was done outside the standard /gsd:execute-phase workflow.

Output: VERIFICATION.md documenting each BUILD requirement as verified/passed, SUMMARY.md with requirements-completed frontmatter listing all BUILD requirement IDs.

## Existing Codebase State

Per STATE.md "Phase 1 Completion Summary", the following artifacts were already created:
- tailwind.config.js with content paths and dark mode
- postcss.config.js with Tailwind and Autoprefixer
- src/index.css with Tailwind directives
- index.html with local CSS and favicon references
- public/favicon.ico
- vite.config.ts with Vercel optimization
- vercel.json for deployment
- .gitignore with build artifacts

This verification plan confirms these artifacts exist and meet requirements without re-implementing.

    package.json
    tailwind.config.js
    postcss.config.js
    src/index.css
    index.html
  </files>
  <action>
    Verify the following requirements by reading and examining existing files:

    **BUILD-01: Install Tailwind CSS and PostCSS dependencies**
    - Read package.json
    - Confirm devDependencies contains: tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer
    - Note: Exact versions don't matter, only presence of packages

    **BUILD-02: Create tailwind.config.js with content paths**
    - Read tailwind.config.js
    - Confirm content array includes: "./index.html" and "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
    - Confirm darkMode: 'class' is set
    - Confirm theme.extend object exists

    **BUILD-03: Create postcss.config.js with Tailwind plugin**
    - Read postcss.config.js
    - Confirm plugins object includes tailwindcss and autoprefixer

    **BUILD-04: Create src/index.css with Tailwind directives**
    - Read src/index.css
    - Confirm file contains: @tailwind base, @tailwind components, @tailwind utilities
    - Custom styles beyond directives are acceptable

    **BUILD-05: Update index.html to remove Tailwind CDN and add local CSS**
    - Read index.html
    - Confirm NO Tailwind CDN script (should NOT contain cdn.tailwindcss.com)
    - Confirm link to local CSS: href="/src/index.css"
    - Confirm favicon link: href="/favicon.ico"

    Document verification results in VERIFICATION.md with format:
    ```markdown
    ## BUILD-XX: [Requirement Name]
    **Status:** PASSED
    **Evidence:** [What was confirmed in the file]
    **File:** [path]
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    After creating VERIFICATION.md, confirm it contains entries for BUILD-01 through BUILD-05, each with Status: PASSED and specific evidence.
  </verify>
  <done>
    VERIFICATION.md exists with BUILD-01 through BUILD-05 verified as PASSED based on actual file content examination.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Verify BUILD-06 through BUILD-08: Favicon, Vite config, and build artifacts</name>
  <files>
    public/favicon.ico
    vite.config.ts
    vercel.json
    .gitignore
  </files>
  <action>
    Verify the following requirements by reading and examining existing files:

    **BUILD-06: Create favicon.ico and add to index.html**
    - Run `ls -la public/favicon.ico` to confirm file exists
    - Read index.html and confirm favicon link exists (already verified in Task 1)
    - File size should be non-zero (e.g., 4286 bytes as shown in STATE.md)

    **BUILD-07: Update vite.config.ts with Vercel-optimized settings**
    - Read vite.config.ts
    - Confirm base: './' for relative paths (Vercel compatibility)
    - Confirm build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks exists with code splitting
    - Confirm build.sourcemap: true is set
    - Confirm plugins array includes react()

    **BUILD-08: Fix console errors (backend API 404s, favicon 404)**
    - Backend API 404: Confirm vite.config.ts proxy configuration exists for /api
    - Favicon 404: Confirmed via BUILD-06 (favicon exists and is linked)
    - Read .gitignore and confirm dist/, build/, .env files are excluded

    Append verification results to VERIFICATION.md with same format as Task 1:
    ```markdown
    ## BUILD-XX: [Requirement Name]
    **Status:** PASSED
    **Evidence:** [What was confirmed]
    **File:** [path]
    ```

    After documenting all BUILD-01 through BUILD-08, add summary section to VERIFICATION.md:
    ```markdown
    ## Summary
    **Total Requirements:** 8
    **Passed:** 8
    **Failed:** 0
    **Blocked:** 0

    All BUILD requirements have been verified as satisfied.
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    Confirm VERIFICATION.md contains BUILD-06 through BUILD-08 with Status: PASSED, plus summary section showing 8/8 requirements passed.
  </verify>
  <done>
    VERIFICATION.md complete with all 8 BUILD requirements verified, summary section showing 100% pass rate.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create SUMMARY.md with requirements-completed frontmatter</name>
  <files>
    .planning/phases/01.1-verify-build-foundation/01.1-01-SUMMARY.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Create SUMMARY.md using the template from /home/bono/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md.

    **Frontmatter requirements:**
    - Must include `requirements-completed: ["BUILD-01", "BUILD-02", "BUILD-03", "BUILD-04", "BUILD-05", "BUILD-06", "BUILD-07", "BUILD-08"]`
    - Must include `phase: 01.1-verify-build-foundation`
    - Must include `plan: 01`

    **Content sections:**
    - Overview: Brief description of verification phase (gap closure, no code changes)
    - Requirements Verified: List all 8 BUILD requirements with status
    - Artifacts Examined: List files verified (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, etc.)
    - Findings: Summary that all artifacts exist and meet requirements
    - Next Steps: None (verification complete)

    This is a **gap closure verification phase**, so:
    - No new code was written
    - All work existed from Phase 1 (completed per STATE.md)
    - Only verification artifacts were created (VERIFICATION.md, this SUMMARY.md)

    After creating SUMMARY.md, verify frontmatter is valid YAML format with proper array syntax for requirements-completed.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `node /home/bono/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs frontmatter validate .planning/phases/01.1-verify-build-foundation/01.1-01-SUMMARY.md`
    Confirm output shows `valid: true`
  </verify>
  <done>
    SUMMARY.md created with valid frontmatter including requirements-completed array listing all 8 BUILD requirement IDs.
  </done>
</task>

## Verification Checklist

After completing all tasks, verify:

1. **VERIFICATION.md exists** at `.planning/phases/01.1-verify-build-foundation/01.1-01-VERIFICATION.md`
   - Contains all 8 BUILD requirements (BUILD-01 through BUILD-08)
   - Each requirement has Status: PASSED
   - Each requirement has Evidence field describing what was confirmed
   - Summary section shows 8/8 passed

2. **SUMMARY.md exists** at `.planning/phases/01.1-verify-build-foundation/01.1-01-SUMMARY.md`
   - Frontmatter includes `requirements-completed: ["BUILD-01", ...]`
   - Frontmatter validates successfully with gsd-tools
   - Overview explains this is a gap closure verification phase
   - No code changes documented (verification only)

3. **No code modifications**
   - All existing files remain unchanged
   - Only documentation artifacts created (VERIFICATION.md, SUMMARY.md)

4. **Build still passes**
   - `npm run build` succeeds without errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 1.1 verification complete when:
- VERIFICATION.md documents all 8 BUILD requirements as PASSED with specific evidence
- SUMMARY.md has valid frontmatter with requirements-completed array
- No code files were modified (verification only)
- Gap documented in audit finding is now closed with proper GSD artifacts
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01.1-verify-build-foundation/01.1-01-SUMMARY.md` with requirements-completed frontmatter listing all BUILD requirement IDs.
</output>
