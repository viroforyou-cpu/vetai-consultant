# Context: Verify Build Foundation

**Phase Type:** Gap Closure - Verification Phase
**Created:** 2026-02-19

## Gap Being Closed

**Audit Finding:** Phase 1 (Build Foundation) marked complete in ROADMAP.md but missing VERIFICATION.md documentation.

**Root Cause:** Phase was executed (work completed per STATE.md) but not through the GSD `/gsd:execute-phase` workflow, so verification artifacts were never created.

**Evidence from STATE.md:**
- Tailwind CSS migrated from CDN to PostCSS build
- Favicon created at public/favicon.ico
- Vite config optimized for Vercel
- Build status: ✅ Passing (npm run build succeeds)
- All BUILD-01 through BUILD-08 marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md

## Requirements to Verify

- BUILD-01: Install Tailwind CSS and PostCSS dependencies
- BUILD-02: Create tailwind.config.js with content paths
- BUILD-03: Create postcss.config.js with Tailwind plugin
- BUILD-04: Create src/index.css with Tailwind directives
- BUILD-05: Update index.html to remove Tailwind CDN and add local CSS
- BUILD-06: Create favicon.ico and add to index.html
- BUILD-07: Update vite.config.ts with Vercel-optimized settings
- BUILD-08: Fix console errors (backend API 404s, favicon 404)

## Success Criteria

1. VERIFICATION.md created confirming all 8 BUILD requirements are met
2. Code artifacts verified to exist and be correct:
   - tailwind.config.js
   - postcss.config.js
   - src/index.css
   - public/favicon.ico
   - vite.config.ts
   - vercel.json
3. Build process tested: `npm run build` succeeds without errors
4. SUMMARY.md created with `requirements-completed: ["BUILD-01", "BUILD-02", ...]`

## What Already Exists (Don't Re-implement)

From STATE.md Phase 1 Completion Summary:
- ✅ tailwind.config.js created with content paths and dark mode
- ✅ postcss.config.js created with Tailwind and Autoprefixer
- ✅ src/index.css updated with Tailwind directives
- ✅ index.html updated to remove CDN, added favicon
- ✅ public/favicon.ico created
- ✅ vite.config.ts updated with Vercel optimization
- ✅ vercel.json created
- ✅ .gitignore updated with build artifacts

## Phase Deliverables

1. **PLAN.md** - Verification plan (how to verify each requirement)
2. **VERIFICATION.md** - Verification results (each BUILD requirement verified as passed)
3. **SUMMARY.md** - Phase summary with `requirements-completed` frontmatter

## Dependencies

- None (verification only)
- Codebase should already have all artifacts
