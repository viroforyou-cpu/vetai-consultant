# Milestone v1.0 — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** ⚠️ **GAPS FOUND**
**Score:** 0/28 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.0 audit revealed **critical verification gaps**. While ROADMAP.md marks Phases 1 and 2 as complete, no VERIFICATION.md files exist for any phase. Without phase verification documentation, all 28 requirements are marked as **unsatisfied**.

### Critical Findings

1. **No Phase Verification Documentation**: None of the 3 phase directories contain VERIFICATION.md files
2. **No Phase Summary Documentation**: None of the 3 phase directories contain SUMMARY.md files
3. **Process Gap**: Phases appear to have been planned but never executed through the GSD execution workflow

### Root Cause

The phases show planning documents (PLAN.md, CONTEXT.md) but are missing the execution artifacts:
- **VERIFICATION.md** - Created during `/gsd:execute-phase` to verify success criteria
- **SUMMARY.md** - Created after execution with `requirements-completed` frontmatter

This indicates phases were **planned but never executed** using the GSD workflow.

## Requirements Coverage

### By Phase

| Phase | Requirements | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Phase 1: Build Foundation | 8/8 unsatisfied | ❌ Missing verification |
| Phase 2: GLM Integration | 5/5 unsatisfied | ❌ Missing verification |
| Phase 3: Supabase Database | 4/4 unsatisfied | ❌ Not started |
| Phase 4: Storage & Migration | 4/4 unsatisfied | ❌ Phase doesn't exist |
| Phase 5: GitHub & Vercel | 5/5 unsatisfied | ❌ Phase doesn't exist |
| Phase 6: Production Deployment | 2/2 unsatisfied | ❌ Phase doesn't exist |

### Detailed Requirements Status

#### Phase 1: Build Foundation (All 8 unsatisfied)

| REQ-ID | Description | Status | Issue |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| BUILD-01 | Install Tailwind CSS and PostCSS dependencies | ❌ | No verification |
| BUILD-02 | Create tailwind.config.js with content paths | ❌ | No verification |
| BUILD-03 | Create postcss.config.js with Tailwind plugin | ❌ | No verification |
| BUILD-04 | Create src/index.css with Tailwind directives | ❌ | No verification |
| BUILD-05 | Update index.html to remove Tailwind CDN | ❌ | No verification |
| BUILD-06 | Create favicon.ico and add to index.html | ❌ | No verification |
| BUILD-07 | Update vite.config.ts with Vercel-optimized settings | ❌ | No verification |
| BUILD-08 | Fix console errors (backend API 404s, favicon 404) | ❌ | No verification |

#### Phase 2: GLM Integration (All 5 unsatisfied)

| REQ-ID | Description | Status | Issue |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| GLM-01 | Configure ZhipuAI API endpoint for GLM 4.7 | ❌ | No verification |
| GLM-02 | Implement chat completions for transcript analysis | ❌ | No verification |
| GLM-03 | Implement embedding generation using GLM embedding-3 | ❌ | No verification |
| GLM-04 | Add rate limiting with exponential backoff | ❌ | No verification |
| GLM-05 | Add robust error handling with retry logic | ❌ | No verification |

#### Phase 3: Supabase Database (All 4 unsatisfied)

| REQ-ID | Description | Status | Issue |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| SUPA-01 | Set up Supabase project with PostgreSQL | ❌ | Phase not started |
| SUPA-02 | Enable pgvector and create consultations table | ❌ | Phase not started |
| SUPA-03 | Add embedding column VECTOR(1536) | ❌ | Phase not started |
| SUPA-04 | Create HNSW vector similarity search index | ❌ | Phase not started |

#### Remaining Phases (All unsatisfied - phases don't exist)

- **Phase 4**: SUPA-05, SUPA-06, SUPA-07, SUPA-08 (4 reqs)
- **Phase 5**: DEPLOY-01, DEPLOY-02, DEPLOY-03, DEPLOY-04, DEPLOY-05 (5 reqs)
- **Phase 6**: DEPLOY-06, DEPLOY-07 (2 reqs)

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status:** Cannot assess - no phase execution artifacts

Without VERIFICATION.md or SUMMARY.md files, integration cannot be verified. The following would normally be checked:

- ❌ API routes created in Phase 2 callable from Phase 3+
- ❌ Data models from Phase 1 used in Phase 3+
- ❌ Build artifacts from Phase 1 deployable in Phase 5+

## End-to-End Flows

**Status:** Cannot assess - no phase execution artifacts

Critical user flows that should be verified:
- ❌ **Upload Flow**: Record → Transcribe → Save → Search
- ❌ **Search Flow**: Query → Embed → Vector Search → Results
- ❌ **Deployment Flow**: Build → Deploy → Verify Production

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Execute Phase 1**: Run `/gsd:execute-phase 01-build-foundation` to create verification
2. **Execute Phase 2**: Run `/gsd:execute-phase 02-glm-integration` to create verification
3. **Plan Phase 3**: Run `/gsd:plan-phase 03-supabase-database` to create execution plan
4. **Complete All Phases**: Execute through Phase 6 before re-auditing

### Alternative: Re-map from Current State

If phases were completed outside GSD workflow:
1. Create VERIFICATION.md manually for each completed phase
2. Verify success criteria are actually met
3. Create SUMMARY.md with `requirements-completed` frontmatter

## Tech Debt

No tech debt identified - phases were never executed, so no execution-time issues accumulated.

**Next Steps:** Use `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` or execute phases to complete milestone requirements.
